# MachineLearning Practice

## #1
* Dataset : Wine data set has different measured properties of different wines. 
* Goal: To develop two machine learning models to predict the quality of an unseen wine given these properties and check their performance. 

## #2
* Dataset: Hateval dataset.
* Goal: Train an SVM binary classifier to predict whether a tweet represents hate speech or not. You can preprocess and choose the features freely. Evaluate the performance of your classifier in terms of accuracy using ten fold-cross validation. 

## #3
* Dataset:The sentiment analysis dataset provided including positive and negative movie reviews, including training development and test splits 
* Goal: Dataset is provided to be analyzed by steps of preprocessing the data, selecting a feature and training a machine learning model. Firstly, these methods used in my project are introduced in detail. In the last part of this report, the table of performance is provided to compare different features and models on aspects of efficiency and accuracy and find the best solution.
